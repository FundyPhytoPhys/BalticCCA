# 1. Introduction {.unnumbered}
If we can get growth return upon PSII ETR and/or JVPSII and the quantitative benefit of CCA then we can send this to...
J. Phyco
ISME??
Photosynthesis Research

Think about target journals...
....

Tasks:

i) Extract slopes from O2 data; tricky b/c we need to set boundaries for light steps

ii) Replot O2 slopes vs. PAR

iii) Plot JVPSII and/or PSII ETR vs. PAR

iv) Generate representative spectral figures from OLIS
  Deconvolute pigment peaks from OLIS to 'show' CCA
  
v) Figure out how to 'pool' estimates across runs to generate central estimates; possibly simply take growth rates as 'points' and average; state in Caption that SE on individual determinations was <= XX or XX% of mean?

vi) Figure out how to plot growth return on JVPSII and on O2 evln; is it consistent or not; does CCA involve changes in e:CO2 (CO2 taken as net O2.....

No obvious experimental work 'missing'.
Most of the needed data transforms overlap with other manuscript
  Which could be merged with this manuscript...?
  
  So Doug suggests initial focus on CCA manuscript

Considering figuring out how to do separate bibliographies for packages vs. for scientific citations?

# 2. Material and Methods {.unnumbered}

Strains change their PE:PC ratio depending upon growth light color, as shown by OLIS spectra

Laboratory work - status: completed

- 2 strains of picocyanobacteria: BA77G, BA127R
- 2 light intensities (Par_ue): 60, 300 µE
- 2 light color (WL): G530, R660
- 1 photoperiod: 12:12
- = 8 combinations

- 3 independent measurements (runs) on color MultiCulti
- Tracking growth (number of cells – N, growth rate – µ) with color MultiCulti (for every 5 minutes) and using linear regression models based on cell suspension density (N mL−1) (PAMAS counter/flow cytometer) and optical density (OD) at 680 & 720 & 750 nm measured from the same samples (ClarioStar spectrophotometer)
- Additionally, tracking the number of cells using PicoDevice (repeatedly in the exponential growth phase) 
- Tracking photosynthetic performance using Solisense and Optode at Ex445, Ex470, Ex505, Ex535, Ex590 (repeatedly in the exponential growth phase) 
- Sub set of data at low to moderate light could be used for calibrations
- Tracking Chl a with Turner (repeatedly in the exponential growth phase)
- Tracking whole cell pigmentation profiles based on Olis spectrophotometer (repeatedly in the exponential growth phase)

Analysis of the results - status: in progress
Article completion date: ~February-March 2023


- OLIS:

  Absorbance measurements on intact cells in suspension were conducted in an Olis-modernized Cary 14 UV/Vis/NIR with Integrating Sphere upgrade spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA, USA) according to the method described by Blake and Griff (2012) with modifications. In an experiment, identical 8 mL solutions that contained f/2 medium, were added to both the sample and reference observation cavities of the spectrophotometer. After recording a baseline from 375 to 710 nm, 4 mL were withdrawn from the sample cavity and replaced with 4 mL of the cell suspension of tested picocyanobacteria. The pathlength corrected absorbance per cm was performed by determining the Javorfi coefficients as described in the equipment manual.

# Comments {.unnumbered}

- Comments and suggestions (07.2022):


Think about faceting.
Could facet by growth light to bring out interaction; does high growth light allow strain to over come 'wrong' colour?

Think about how to pool data from runs and possibly generate a common error bar?

Possible: Make symbol size proportional to SE of run fit and then calculate an overall SE across all replicates taking each replicate as a point
OR in caption state SE on individual determinations of growth rates were always <   .... absolute or proportional

Strain without PE is far more 'fixed' in response to colour; strongly favours 660
Strain with PE BA127R appears more able to accommodate changing colour from green to red...



Generally set Y axis to start at 0

Presenting Chl or PC or PE per cell after a fixed interval is fine as long as there is some 'reason' for the interval.
Presenting absolute Chl mL-1 after fixed interval needs to be presented careful and is only useful in terms of potential to dominate habitat within a reasonable period....

Chl cell-1 could be usefully compared to measures of PSII cell-1 if we can get them from the calibrations...

(Conceptually Doug would prefer PE/PC unless the field generally uses PC/PE - done)

Basis for ratio:
ug PC/ug PE?
Peak PC/Peak PE...

From OLIS could be peak height or peak area after deconvolution...

Extract OLIS data to confirm/alter interpretations from filter data...

Extract slopes of O2 umol L-1 s-1 from O2 data
Replot slopes vs. incident light

Compare O2 slopes to PSII ETR and/or JVPSII slopes to get O2 : e-...  is achieved conversion of PSII ETR to O2 similar or variable?

Mechanistically always 1 O2 : 4 e- from PSII, but re-consumption of e- and O2 can alter measured ratio.
Compare growth rates per PSII ETR and growth rates per O2;  does PSII ETR limit achieved growth rate or do intervening processes alter conversion of net reductant (complement of measure O2 evolution) to growth

- Comments and suggestions (21.11.2022):

Tubes under green or red were inoculated from white light precultures so first days in MultiCulti spectra will be changing

Figure Raw Growth. Formatted example of MultiCulti output (could be a 'Supplemental').

Figure Growth.  Multipanel figure of growth rates somehow?  Depending upon order of coverage could be first or last?  But probably, first.  This is probably a bar and whiskers plot with a bar/whiskers for each growth combination of strain, colour and light level
How to organize?
Could emphasize strain to strain contrast
BA127 R cvs. BA77G under 60 and Green
Then
BA127 R cvs. BA77G under 300 and Green
....
Or, could think of some sort of scatter plot heat map?
Heat map for each strain each heat map with 4 cells for colour and light level?

Decide how to estimate growth rates
- Do not number figures until we are finished. Name them.
We may need a panel Letter on each 'facet' or maybe not depending upon journal.  There is a way ('CowPlot'?) or other to add letters to each panel.
We will use the code to add the 'variable' name as well as the variable 'value' to the facet labels (later)

- Think of Y axis scaling; why did ggplot scale to 0.2 A when maximum value is only ~0.08?  Are there missing points? #Fixed
- Consider whether to normalize spectra to common wavelength absorbance or not?  Consider normalization to A680 or A440 #Done - at 440

To emphasize CCA changes in PC and PE, consider overlay of spectra from green and red light.
What is the peak at 480 nm? phycourobilin? carotenoids
Also: lab tests with Mireille; is there something wrong with the baseline correction b/c spectral peaks seem to be asymmetric; instead of gaussian

To normalize, probably something like
mutate(Anorm = A/A[nm == 440]
To lower noise, we might normalize to something like the mean of A 438-442…

Why is the plateau reached at 0.8, across growth conditions?

Figure “OlisSpectra” shows:
-both strains change PC/PE ratio depending upon growth light colour (show CCA of some form)
-both strains show a 480 nm peak which may increase under high light?
-both strains show change in the PB to Chl ratio under low to high light?
-estimate peaks normalized to scatter? or content per cell?
-consider deconvolutions (code draft exists  but not yet run)
-consider plotting metric of light capture capacity vs. growth rate
    if we estimate cellular photosynthetic absorbance X PAR can we predict growth rate?
    -does CCA alter the growth return on incident light
    -we can estimate 'in silico' b/c you have the whole cell spectra for red light, and the growth rate for red light, and vice versa for green light
    so we can take whole cell absorbance under red light and multiply by hypothetical 
incident green light

Add r overlay incident light spectra on top of absorbance spectra?

Mix of 'techincal’ measures and measures from separate tubes?
Debate what is a 'replicate';  each panel contains measures from at least 2 tubes, usually 3; some 'replicates' are remeasurements of subsamples from the same tube the next day  All measures taken from actively growth cultures (exponential...); and we have high resolution growth curves

- What about other growth metrics; Turner chlorophyll? PICO cell counts? ClarioStar absorbance
- Ask Doug how he calculated the light response curves of photochemical and non-photochemical quenching for cyanobacteria
