  abstract = {Amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses have been used to examine the relationships among 100 phycobiliprotein sequences. The alignments revealed a number of highly conserved amino acid residues that are involved in chromophore attachment and conformation, {$\alpha$}-{$\beta$} interactions and phycobilisome assembly. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the phycobiliprotein subfamilies, previously classified by their biochemical and spectroscopic properties, also formed coherent evolutionary groups. The {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} subunits formed two distinct evolutionary lines that originate from a common ancestor. The pattern of divergence among the {$\alpha$} subfamilies was identical to that of the {$\beta$} subfamilies, strongly suggesting that the {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} subunits of each phycobiliprotein type have coevolved. The phylogenetic data support a monophyletic separation of the eukaryotic sequences from the extant cyanobacterial sequences. The eukaryotic phycoerythrins appeared more closely related to the marineSynechococcusphycoerythrins than to the other cyanobacterial phycoerythrins. The cryptophyte phycobiliproteins formed a monophyletic group within the rhodophyte lineage. In conjunction with other phylogenetic markers, the analysis of additional phycobiliprotein sequences may help to further resolve the relationships among phycobiliprotein-containing organisms.},

Most strikingly, red-illuminated cultures contain no measurable C-phycoerythrin and have a mean filament length about 10 times shorter than fluorescent-illuminated cultures. C-phycoerythrin behaves as a photoinducible constituent of this alga. Spectrophotometric and immunochemical procedures were devised so that C-phycoerythrin metabolism could be studied quantitatively with [14C]-phenylalanine pulse-chased cultures. Transfer of red-illuminated cultures to fluorescent light initiates C-phycoerythrin production by essentially de novo synthesis. C-phycoerythrin is not degraded to any significant extent in cultures continuously illuminated with fluorescent light. Transfer of fluorescent-illuminated cultures to red light causes an abrupt cessation of C-phycoerythrin synthesis. The C-phycoerythrin content of cultures adapting to red light decreases and subsequently becomes constant. Loss of C-phycoerythrin is not brought about by metabolic degradation, but rather by a decrease in mean filament length which is effected by transcellular breakage. In this experimental system, light influences intracellular C-phycoerythrin levels by regulating the rate of synthesis of the chromoprotein.}

The organism is phycoerythrin rich, does not contain phycourobilin, and is not capable of complementary chromatic adaptation.

Therefore, it can be predicted that certain species reduce aquaculture performance. Herein, the allelopathic ability of 123 different taxa of green, red, and brown algae have been summarized based on literature reports. Research on macroalgae and their allelopathic effects on other animal organisms was conducted primarily in Australia, Mexico, and the United States. Nevertheless, there are also several scientific reports in this field from South America and Asia; the study areas in the latter continents coincide with areas where aquaculture is highly developed and widely practiced. Therefore, the allelopathic activity of macroalgae on coexisting animals is an issue that is worth careful investigation. In this work, we characterize the distribution of allelopathic macroalgae and compare them with aquaculture locations, describe the methods for the study of macroalgal allelopathy, present the taxonomic position of allelopathic macroalgae and their impact on coexisting aquatic competitors (Cnidaria) and herbivores (Annelida, Echinodermata, Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Chordata), and compile information on allelopathic compounds produced by different macroalgae species. This work gathers the current knowledge on the phenomenon of macroalgal allelopathy and their allelochemicals affecting aquatic animal (competitors and predators) worldwide and it provides future research directions for this topic.},

  abstract = {The cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. strain PCC 7601 drastically changes phycobiliprotein composition and colour in response to light quality, through complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA). Red light promotes phycocyanin-II and inhibits phycoerythrin synthesis, while green light has the opposite effect, through changes in transcription regulated by a putative green/red photoreceptor(s). The effects of CCA on photosynthesis were characterized by measuring oxygen evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Cells fully acclimated to either red or green light achieve a similar photosynthetic quantum yield of oxygen evolution (light-use efficiency). Shifting acclimated cells from green to red or from red to green light caused similar 40\% drops in photosynthetic quantum yield. Therefore, full CCA significantly increases light use efficiency, which is of great importance under light-limited growth. Cells growing under red light are in state I, with very low PS II to PS I energy transfer, since red light is absorbed both by phycocyanin in the phycobilisome/PS II supracomplex and by PS I chlorophyll. Cells growing under green light are in state II, with high transfer of excitation energy from the phycobilisome/PS II supracomplex to PS I. This transfer allows green light captured by phycoerythrin to ultimately drive both PS I and PS II photochemistry.,}

Vegetative filaments differentiate motile, gas-vacuolated hormogonia after transfer to fresh medium and incubation under red light. Hormogonia are transient and give rise to vegetative filaments, or to heterocystous filaments if fixed nitrogen is lacking. If incubated under green light after transfer to fresh medium, vegetative filaments do not differentiate hormogonia but may produce heterocysts directly, even in the presence of combined nitrogen. We used inhibitors of thylakoid electron transport (3-[3,4-dichlorophenyl]-1,1-dimethylurea and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone) to show that the opposing effects of red and green light on cell differentiation arise through differential excitations of photosystems I and II. Red light excitation of photosystem I oxidizes the plastoquinone pool, stimulating differentiation of hormogonia and inhibiting heterocyst differentiation. Conversely, net reduction of plastoquinone by green light excitation of photosystem II inhibits differentiation of hormogonia and stimulates heterocyst differentiation. This photoperception mechanism is distinct from the light regulation of complementary chromatic adaptation of phycobilisome constituents. Although complementary chromatic adaptation operates independently of the photocontrol of cellular differentiation, these two regulatory processes are linked, because the general expression of phycobiliprotein genes is transiently repressed during hormogonium differentiation. In addition, absorbance by phycobilisomes largely determines the light wavelengths that excite photosystem II, and thus the wavelengths that can imbalance electron transport.}

Photosynthetic organisms can modulate their relative pigment content in response to changes in either light intensity or light wavelength. Generally, one observes an inverse correlation between light intensity and pigment content\textemdash the less light energy available, the more photosynthetic pigments are synthesized by the cells. The effect of light wavelength on the pigment content of the cells, termed complementary chromatic adaptation, appears to be restricted to some cyanobacteria. In this type of adaptation, changes in cell pigmentation in response to specific spectral illuminations result from modifications of the relative amounts of the red-colored phycoerythrin (PE) and the blue-colored phycocyanin (PC), with a predominance of PE in green-light-grown cells and of PC in red-light-grown cells. The regulatory processes involved in complementary chromatic adaptation are controlled by a photoreceptor pigment system which presumably acts at the transcriptional level. The property of photoreversibility of the cyanobacterial photoreceptor resembles that of the phytochrome present in higher plants and algae, although its action maxima are situated at shorter wavelengths in the visible spectrum.},

Recent research has suggested that these spectral forms of PE have a different evolutionary history than the core genome. However, a lack of explicit statistical testing of alternative hypotheses or for selection on these genes has made it difficult to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between spectral forms of PE or the role horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may have had in the adaptive phenotypic evolution of the pigment system in marine Synechococcus. In this work, PE phylogenies of picocyanobacteria with known spectral phenotypes, including newly co-isolated strains of marine Synechococcus from the Gulf of Mexico, were constructed to explore the diversification of spectral phenotype and PE evolution in this group more completely. For the first time, statistical evaluation of competing evolutionary hypotheses and tests for positive selection on the PE locus in picocyanobacteria were performed. Genes for PEs associated with specific PE spectral phenotypes formed strongly supported monophyletic clades within the PE tree with positive directional selection driving evolution towards higher phycourobilin (PUB) content. The presence of the PUB-lacking phenotype in PE-containing marine picocyanobacteria from cyanobacterial lineages identified as Cyanobium is best explained by HGT into this group from marine Synechococcus. Taken together, these data provide strong examples of adaptive evolution of a single phenotypic trait in bacteria via mutation, positive directional selection and horizontal gene transfer.},

Some visually dramatic changes in pigmentation of cyanobacterial cells that occur during changing nutrient and light conditions reflect marked alterations in components of the major light-harvesting complex in these organisms, the phycobilisome. As noted well over 100 years ago, the pigment composition of some cyanobacteria is very sensitive to ambient wavelengths of light; this sensitivity reflects molecular changes in polypeptide constituents of the phycobilisome. The levels of different pigmented polypeptides or phycobiliproteins that become associated with the phycobilisome are adjusted to optimize absorption of excitation energy present in the environment. This process, called complementary chromatic adaptation, is controlled by a bilin-binding photoreceptor related to phytochrome of vascular plants; however, many other regulatory elements also play a role in chromatic adaptation. My perspectives and biases on the history and significance of this process are presented in this essay.},

Growth and phycoerythrin (PE) concentration per unit carbon increased when marine Synechococcus WH7803 was grown under green light as compared to red light, but no change in phycocyanin concentration occurred. Marine Synechococcus strain 48B66 also showed greater levels of PE when grown under green light than under red light, but no concomitant growth increase occurred. Both strains thus exhibited Group II chromatic adaptation. Additionally, strain 48B66 increased the relative level of phycourobilin compared to phycoerythrobilin when grown under red light. In contrast, both marine and freshwater Synechococcus strains containing no PE showed decreased growth under green light. Chlorophyll a concentrations were greatest or among the greatest in all strains grown under green light. These results suggest that light quality, through its effects on growth rate, may be an important factor controlling the distribution and abundance of the various pigment types of Synechococcus.},

The model incorporates multi-spectral optics and light absorption properties for the different phytoplankton. The model successfully reproduced observed vertical gradients in the nitrate, bulk phytoplankton properties and community structure. Model phytoplankton types with Synechococcus-like spectral light absorption properties were outcompeted at depth, where eukaryote-like spectral properties were advantageous. In contrast, photoinhibition was important for vertical separation of high-light and low-light Prochlorococcus model analogues. In addition, temperature dependence was important for selection of phytoplankton types on the temperature gradient. The fittest, or successful, phytoplankton types were characterised by combinations of simultaneously optimal traits that suited them to a particular depth in the water column, reflecting the view that phytoplankton have co-evolved multiple traits that are advantageous in a particular environmental condition or niche.},

  abstract = {One of the most fascinating recent developments in the field of microbiology is the growing recognition that a large number of bacterial species are capable of sensing and responding to many different light colors. Much of this has come from analysis of bacterial genome sequences, which has shown that genes encoding a superfamily of phytochrome-class photoreceptors exist in both nonphotosynthetic and photosynthetic prokaryotes (1). Cyanobacteria, which make their living via photosynthesis, contain an especially large number of genes encoding such photoreceptors. As yet, the mechanisms and cellular roles of most of these have not been elucidated. In PNAS, Hirose et al. (21) provide interesting new insights into a cyanobacterial phytochrome-regulated sensory system that controls the production of proteins used to capture light for photosynthesis, raising new possibilities to explain how such systems evolved. Phytochromes, identified in plants more than 50 years ago, have been intensively studied (3). They sense light color using a bilin chromophore and undergo photoreversible conversion between red and far-red light-absorbing forms, thereby regulating many aspects of plant growth and development. Despite a growing understanding of their structure and function, plant phytochromes remained orphan photoreceptors for decades. Many suspected that they came from cyanobacteria, and in the 1990s two groups provided the first solid evidence for this. The sequenced genome of Synechocystis PCC 6803 revealed possible phytochrome-encoding genes (4) and complementation of a Fremyella diplosiphon UTEX 481 ( Tolypothrix PCC 7601) mutant that had lost its ability to correctly light regulate the production of its photosynthetic light-harvesting proteins uncovered the phytochrome-class photoreceptor RcaE (5, 6). An interesting feature of the cyanobacterial phytochrome family is that, unlike plant phytochromes, many members maximally respond to colors other than red and far red. This was suggested by the discovery of RcaE because it controls a red\textendash green light response, but \ldots},

In certain cyanobacteria the wavelengths of light in the environment control the synthesis of specific polypeptides of light harvesting antenna complex or phycobilisome. This phenomenon, called complementary chromatic adaptation, is most dramatically observed in comparison of cyanobacteria after growth in green light and red light. In red light-grown cells the phycobilisome is largely composed of phycocyanin and its associated linker polypeptides (the latter are important for the assembly of the phycocyanin subunits and their placement within the light harvesting structure); the organisms appear blue-green color. In green light-grown cells the phycobilisome is largely composed of phycoerythrin and its associated linker polypeptides; the organisms appear red in color. The ways in which these cyanobacteria sense their changing light environment and the regulatory elements involved in controlling the process of complementary chromatic adaptation are discussed in this review.},

During CCA, cyanobacterial cells change from brick red to bright blue green, depending on their light color environment. The apparent simplicity of this spectacular, photoreversible event belies the complexity of the cellular response to changes in light color. Recent results have shown that the regulation of CCA is also complex and involves at least three pathways. One is controlled by a phytochrome-class photoreceptor that is responsive to green and red light and a complex two-component signal transduction pathway, whereas another is based on sensing redox state. Studies of CCA are uncovering the strategies used by photosynthetic organisms during light acclimation and the means by which they regulate these responses.},

  abstract = {At 32 stations covering a wide variety of phytoplankton biomass, results have been obtained for in situ production, daily irradiation, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and spectral composition of submarine radiant energy. PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, {$\epsilon$}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. {$\epsilon$} varies from less than 0.01\% to about 0.1\% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8\%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3\% ({$\pm$}1.5\%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield {$\varphi$} and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for {$\varphi$} emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light.},

  abstract = {Non-heterocystous, mostly filamentous cyanobacteria were isolated from the crust of stones, from the periphyton of two macrophytes from the littoral zone and from the pelagic environment of Lake Constance. All isolates were cultivated as unialgal strains. DNA analysis by restriction fragment length polymorphism with the psbA gene probe revealed high genetic diversity among the strains from the littoral zone. For all genotypes, the occurrence of the nifH gene encoding a nitrogenase subunit and of genes encoding subunits of phycoerythrin and phycocyanin were tested by Southern blot hybridization. In addition, the isolates were investigated for their ability for complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA) and for anaerobic N2-fixation. With respect to these characteristics, all cyanobacteria included in this study were assigned to four different types: (1) strains without the capability to fix N2 or to perform CCA of the group III type (CCA III); (2) strains which show both features; (3) strains with the ability to fix nitrogen, but that do not show any CCA III; and (4) strains that produce phycoerythrin, but without the capacity for CCA III or N2-fixation. By examining the frequency distribution of isolates, these types were shown to prefer different habitats. While cyanobacterial strains capable of N2-fixation, but without CCA III, were mainly obtained from stone crusts in the supralittoral zone, those with the potential for N2-fixation as well as for CCA III were largely isolated from submersed macrophytes. Cyanobacteria that produce phycoerythrin, but do not perform CCA III or N2-fixation, were found in the pelagic zone only.}

  abstract = {The dazzling diversity of the phytoplankton has puzzled biologists for decades1,2,3,4,5. The puzzle has been enlarged rather than solved by the progressive discovery of new phototrophic microorganisms in the oceans, including picocyanobacteria6,7, pico-eukaryotes8, and bacteriochlorophyll-based9,10,11 and rhodopsin-based phototrophic bacteria12,13. Physiological and genomic studies suggest that natural selection promotes niche differentiation among these phototrophic microorganisms, particularly with respect to their photosynthetic characteristics14,15,16. We have analysed competition for light between two closely related picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus group that we isolated from the Baltic Sea17. One of these two has a red colour because it contains the pigment phycoerythrin, whereas the other is blue-green because it contains high contents of the pigment phycocyanin. Here we report theory and competition experiments that reveal stable coexistence of the two picocyanobacteria, owing to partitioning of the light spectrum. Further competition experiments with a third marine cyanobacterium, capable of adapting its pigment composition, show that this species persists by investing in the pigment that absorbs the colour not used by its competitors. These results demonstrate the adaptive significance of divergence in pigment composition of phototrophic microorganisms, which allows an efficient utilization of light energy and favours species coexistence.},

  abstract = {Although phenotypic plasticity can be advantageous in fluctuating environments, it may come too late if the environment changes fast. Complementary chromatic adaptation is a colorful form of phenotypic plasticity, where cyanobacteria tune their pigmentation to the prevailing light spectrum. Here, we study the timescale of chromatic adaptation and its impact on competition among phytoplankton species exposed to fluctuating light colors. We parameterized a resource competition model using monoculture experiments with green and red picocyanobacteria and the cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena, which can change its color within {$\sim$}7 days by chromatic adaptation. The model predictions were tested in competition experiments, where the incident light color switched between red and green at different frequencies (slow, intermediate, and fast). Pseudanabaena (the flexible phenotype) competitively excluded the green and red picocyanobacteria in all competition experiments. Strikingly, the rate of competitive exclusion was much faster when the flexible phenotype had sufficient time to fully adjust its pigmentation. Thus, the flexible phenotype benefited from its phenotypic plasticity if fluctuations in light color were relatively slow, corresponding to slow mixing processes or infrequent storms in their natural habitat. This shows that the timescale of phenotypic plasticity plays a key role during species interactions in fluctuating environments.},

  abstract = {Due to the selective attenuation of solar light and the absorption properties of seawater and seawater constituents, free-floating photosynthetic organisms have to cope with rapid and unpredictable changes in both intensity and spectral quality. We have studied the transcriptional, metabolic and photo-physiological responses to light of different spectral quality in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum through time-series studies of cultures exposed to equal doses of photosynthetically usable radiation of blue, green and red light. The experiments showed that short-term differences in gene expression and profiles are mainly light quality-dependent. Transcription of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes was activated mainly through a light quality-independent mechanism likely to rely on chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. In contrast, genes encoding proteins important for photoprotection and PSII repair were highly dependent on a blue light receptor-mediated signal. Changes in energy transfer efficiency by light-harvesting pigments were spectrally dependent; furthermore, a declining trend in photosynthetic efficiency was observed in red light. The combined results suggest that diatoms possess a light quality-dependent ability to activate photoprotection and efficient repair of photodamaged PSII. In spite of approximately equal numbers of PSII-absorbed quanta in blue, green and red light, the spectral quality of light is important for diatom responses to ambient light conditions.},
