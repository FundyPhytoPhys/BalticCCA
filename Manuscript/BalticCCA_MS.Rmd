# Notes {.unnumbered}
Culture inoculated from WL fluorescent exponential phase to Green or Red chromatic light do not show CCA, only a slow decline in PC/Chl or PE/Chl depending upon strain.

Culture then 'reinoculated' through 'resupply from stationary phase to chromatic light do show CCA with increase in PC under red and increase in PE under green, for both PC rich and PE rich strains.

Cultures which have depleted phycobilisome content will relaunch into CCA?

Big issue: No functional data for PC rich resuspension.
Functional data for PE rich resuspension
Functional data for exponential & stationary for both PC rich & PE rich.

XXXXX

If we can get growth return upon PSII ETR and/or JVPSII and the quantitative benefit of CCA then we can send this to… J. Phyco ISME?? Photosynthesis Research. Think about target journals… 
ISME (but fee for open access), Environmental Microbiology (Wiley, open access for free)?

Tasks:

Extract slopes from O2 data; tricky b/c we need to set boundaries for light steps

Replot O2 slopes vs. PAR

Plot JVPSII and/or PSII ETR vs. PAR

Generate representative spectral figures from OLIS Deconvolute pigment peaks from OLIS to ‘show’ CCA

Figure out how to ‘pool’ estimates across runs to generate central estimates; possibly simply take growth rates as ‘points’ and average; state in Caption that SE on individual determinations was <= XX or XX% of mean?

Figure out how to plot growth return on JVPSII and on O2 evln; is it consistent or not; does CCA involve changes in e:CO2 (CO2 taken as net O2…..

No obvious experimental work ‘missing.’ Most of the needed data transforms overlap with other manuscript Which could be merged with this manuscript…?

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Complementary chromatic acclimation (CCA) allows some cyanobacteria to adjust phycobiliprotein content, and cellular absorbance, under changing spectral conditions. CCA in picocyanobacteria is of great interest in photosynthesis studies as it allows manipulation of growth and pigment content for both PE-rich and PC-rich strains [@campbellComplementaryChromaticAdaptation1996a]. The aim of the study is to determine the extent and functional consequences of CCA in Baltic picocyanobacteria *Synechococcus* sp. under different light conditions.

<br>

# Materials and methods {.unnumbered}

## Culture condition and experimental setup {.unnumbered}

Non-axenic cultures of Baltic PC-rich (CCBA_077) and PE-rich (CCBA_127) *Synechococcus* (https://ccba.ug.edu.pl/pages/en/home.php) were cultured in Tissue Culture Flasks (VWR International, Cat. No. 10062-872, PA, USA). Pre-cultures were maintained in incubators with a light/dark cycle of 12 hours (h) and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) of 10 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ from fluorescent bulbs (Philips Cool White F14T5/841 Alto) and temperature set on 22℃. Pre-cultures were transferred biweekly to 8 PSU f/2 media [@guillardCulturePhytoplanktonFeeding1975] which reflected their natural brackish habitat.

Controlled growth experiments were performed using MCMIX-OD PSI Multicultivators (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic) set to light/dark cycle of 12 h, 22℃, PAR of 60 or 300 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^, and spectral wavebands of 530 (green) or 660 (red) nm. The round bottom cylindrical glass tubes in MCMIX-OD PSI Multicultivators contained 75 mL of 8 PSU f/2 medium and 5 mL of growing PC-rich or PE-rich *Synechococcus* pre-culture. The pH of tested cultures remained about 8. 

<br>

## Chlorophyll-specific growth rates {.unnumbered}

Picocyanobacterial growth was monitored every 5 minutes by automatically recording OD~680~, OD~720~, and ΔOD (ΔOD = OD~680~ – OD~720~) for at least 7 days, independently for each culture tube. The chlorophyll-specific growth rates (µ) were determined by fitting logistic growth curves using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm [@elzhovMinpackLmInterface2023] to plots of the chlorophyll *a* proxy of ΔOD vs. elapsed time (d) for each combination of strain, light intensity, and spectral waveband.

XXX - separation to phases + experiment where the medium was added after achieving stationary growth phase.

<br>

## Cell counts {.unnumbered}

The OD at 680 nm or 720 nm of cultures was measured using MCMIX-OD PSI Multicultivators and cell suspension density measures were conducted using an ImageXpress Pico Digital microscope equipped with CMOS camera and LED+ image autofocus (ImageXpress Pico Automated Cell Imaging System, Molecular Devices, LLC., CA, USA) [@wlodkowicRecentProgressCytometric2022]. The final picocyanobacterial cells mL^−1^ were estimated using linear regression models of OD at 680 nm or 720 nm vs. calibration counts of cell suspension densities (cell mL^−1^) according to method proposed by @Sliwinska-Wilczewska et al. [2024 XXX add paper to zotero and add proper citation]. 

<br>

## Pigment content and pigment ratio {.unnumbered}

Whole-cell absorbance spectra of picocyanobacteria cells were collected using an integrating cavity spectrophotometer (CLARiTY 17 UV/Vis/NIR, On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA, USA) according to the method proposed by @blakeSituSpectroscopyIntact2012. 

The pigment content (µg mL^−1^) were estimated using linear regression models of pigment content, determined through extraction methods [@stricklandPracticalHandBook1972; @bennettComplementaryChromaticAdaptation1973], and absorbance values of individual pigment peaks (Car; 480 nm, PE; 565 nm, PC; 620 nm, APC; 650 nm, and Chl *a*; 665 nm) obtained from whole-cell absorbance spectra according to method proposed by @Sliwinska-Wilczewska et al. [2024 XXX add paper to zotero and add proper citation]. 

Additionally, using whole-cell absorbance spectra of *Synechococcus* cultures, we estimated Photosynthetically Usable Radiation (PUR; µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) according to [@morelAvailableUsableStored1978]. 

<br>

## Oxygen {.unnumbered}

[O~2~] *in situ* was verified using oxygen optodes (PyroScience, Germany) inserted into tubes for real-time measurements (data not presented), with software correction to account for the salinity of the media (8 PSU). 

XXX Add text about parallel measurements with Solisense!

<br>

## PSII effective absorption cross section of PSII and photochemical quenching {.unnumbered}

We harvested 4 mL of picocyanobacteria cultures repeatedly across the growth trajectories for photophysiological characterizations using Fast Repetition & Relaxation chlorophyll fluorescence (FRRf) [@kolberMeasurementsVariableChlorophyll1998] (Solisense, USA), with a lab built temperature control jacket (22℃). Induction/relaxation trajectories were fit using the onboard Solisense LIFT software [@falkowskiEstimationPhytoplanktonPhotosynthesis1993; @kolberMeasurementsVariableChlorophyll1998].

We used a double tap protocol [@xuConnectivityPhotosystemII2017], where FRRf induction/relaxation trajectories were collected during a rapid actinic light curve sequence increasing in steps of 10 s at 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR. We applied 1 s darkness between the sequential 10 s steps of the light response curves. Flashlets and actinic light were delivered from LED emitters centred at Ex~445nm~, Ex~470nm~, Ex~505nm~, Ex~535nm~, or Ex~590nm~. 

Flashlet power delivered to the samples during the 1.6 µs flashlet duration was adjusted to achieve saturation of variable fluorescence; Ex~445nm~ at 60000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR; Ex~470nm~ at 30000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR; Ex~535nm~ at 25000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR; while for Ex~590nm~ excitation power at 14000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^, calibrated using a quantum sensor (LI-250, LI-COR, Inc.) in the temperature controlled cuvette. 

We estimated effective absorption cross section of PSII (σ~PSII~; nm^2^ quanta^−1^) and the photochemical quenching coefficient (q~P~) using the FRRf induction curves, following [@xuConnectivityPhotosystemII2017].

XXX σ~PSII~′ is effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry under the relevant actinic PAR step (nm^2^ quanta^−1^); q~P~ is an estimate of the fraction of PSII open for photochemistry estimated according to @oxboroughResolvingChlorophyllFluorescence1997.

<br>

## Statistical analysis {.unnumbered}

We used R version 4.3.0 [@rcore] running under RStudio [@posit]. 

We performed three-way factorial ANOVA (*aov()* function; R Base package) to determine whether strain, light intensity, and growth waveband significantly influence the chlorophyll-specific growth rate (µ; d^−1^, Table SXXX), pigment content (Table SXXX), σ~PSII~ (Table SXXX), and q~P~ (Table SXXX). 

The manuscript was prepared as a Rmarkdown document [@handelAndreasHandelCustom2020] with figures plotted using ggplot2 [@wickhamDataAnalysis2016] and patchwork [@pedersenPatchworkComposerPlots2024] packages.

# Results {.unnumbered}

## Chlorophyll-specific growth rates across spectral wavebands, PAR intensity, and strains {.unnumbered}

We used logistic curve fits (Fig. S1) to determine chlorophyll-specific growth rates (μ; d^−1^) for PC-rich and PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* grown under light intensity of 60 or 300 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ and spectral wavebands centred at 530 or 660 nm (Fig. \@ref(fig:GrowthRate)). Growth curves, tracked as OD~680~, OD~720~, ΔOD and logistic fits of ΔOD vs. elapsed time are shown in Fig. S1 in Supplementary materials. Cell-specific growth rates (µ) were also determined using OD~720~ (Fig. S2). Strain, light intensity, growth waveband, and their interactions, significantly affected μ (Table S4). 

Growth rates are higher under green light for the PE-rich strain, but growth under high light causes the red light growth rates to converge towards the green light rate. Growth rates for the PC-rich strain are higher under red light, and do not converge under high light.

## Pigment content and pigment ratio across spectral wavebands, PAR intensity, and strains {.unnumbered}

Fig. \@ref(fig:Pigment)*a* presents Chlorophyll *a* (Chl *a*), Phycobiliproteins (Phyco), or Carotenoids (Car) content (pg cell ^−1^) vs. growth waveband (nm) for PC-rich and PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* grown at spectral wavebands centred at 405, 450, 470, 530, 620, 660, or 730 nm and 250 or 2.5 µM [O~2~]. We also calculated the Car to Chl *a* ratio, and the ratio of the sum of Phycobiliproteins to Chl *a* (µg:µg) for each strain (Fig. S3). Moreover, phycobiliproteins:Chlorophyll *a* ratio (µg:µg) and chlorophyll-specific growth rates (µ; d^−1^) vs. Photosynthetically Usable Radiation (PUR, µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) for PC-rich and PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* grown at spectral wavebands of 405, 450, 470, 530, 620, 660, or 730 nm and 250 µM [O~2~] or 2.5 µM [O~2~] are presented in Fig. S4.

Phycoerythrin(PE)-rich and Phycocyanin(PC)-rich strains of Baltic Sea Synechococcus show significant changes in Chl, PE and PC pigment content, depending upon both the growth light spectra (green vs. red) and level (low vs. high).

## Oxygen {.unnumbered}

Oxygen evolution, measured under both green or red light, for cultures grown under both green or red light, show that the PE-rich strain achieves highest rates under green light, whereas the PC-rich strain achieves highest rates under red light.

Nevertheless, for the PE-rich strain, CCA after sustained red light growth causes oxygen evolution to approach rates achieved under green light. For the PC-rich strain CCA after sustained low green light causes oxygen evolution to approach low red light rates, but CCA was functionally ineffective under high growth light.

## Effective absorption cross sections, turnover times, and photochemical quenching of PSII across spectral wavebands, PAR intensity, and strains {.unnumbered}

Light response curves of effective absorption cross section of PSII (σ~PSII~; nm^2^ quanta^−1^); turnover time of PSII photochemistry (τ~PSII~; µs); and the photochemical quenching coefficient (q~P~) vs. Actinic PAR (µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) (Fig. \@ref(fig:SigLRC)*a-c*) are shown for PC-rich and PE-rich cultures grown in, and excited by, corresponding wavebands of 450, 470, 530, or 620 nm, at 250 µM or 2.5 µM [O~2~]. We omit functional data determined for those PE-rich cultures which showed negligible growth under 405, 450, 730 nm and 250 µM O~2~; and for those PC-rich cultures which showed negligible growth under 405 nm and 250 µM O~2~. In the Supplementary materials (Fig S5-S7), we also show the light response curves for all available excitation (Ex~445nm~, blue; Ex~470nm~, blue-green; Ex~535nm~, green; or Ex~590nm~, orange) and growth waveband (450, 470, 530, or 620 nm) cross-combinations.

σ~PSII~ (Fig. \@ref(fig:SigLRC)*a*), a measure of excitation driving PSII photochemistry, was low and shows little change with increasing actinic light during excitation through chlorophyll at Ex~445nm~. For the PC-rich strain, under orange excitation at Ex~590nm~, σ~PSII~ showed an initial small increase from darkness to the growth light level, followed by a mild decrease with increasing Actinic PAR, and was higher at 250 µM [O~2~] compared to 2.5 µM [O~2~]. For the PE-rich strain, we again see a small increase from darkness to the growth light level, followed by a decrease in σ~PSII~ with increasing Actinic PAR. Moreover, for the PE-rich strain σ~PSII~ was higher in low [O~2~] conditions than in high [O~2~] conditions. Strain, Actinic PAR, and [O~2~] significantly influenced σ~PSII~ under excitation at Ex~590nm~ (Table S6).

q~P~, a measure of the fraction of PSII available for photochemistry,  showed a strong decrease with increasing Actinic PAR across the excitation wavebands tested (Fig. \@ref(fig:SigLRC)*c*). q~P~  generally remained higher for both PC-rich and PE-rich strains under 250 µM [O~2~]. Strain, Actinic PAR, and [O~2~] significantly affected q~P~ at Ex~470nm~, Ex~535nm~, and Ex~590nm~ (Table S8).

# Discussion {.unnumbered}

XXXXX

Both strains show CCA, but the PE-rich strain, based upon light absorption, oxygen evolution and growth responses, appears closer to a CCA generalist able to acclimate to wider changes in spectral regime.

<br>


## CCA interacts with Growth Phase
We find that these picocyanobacteria only show a qualitative shift in phycobiliprotein content when growth is inoculated from stationary phase.  Simple growth under green or red spectral wavebands does not, in itself, provoke complementary chromatic acclimation.

Furthermore, the changes in phycobilisome composition following inoculation from stationary phase is, indeed, CCA, because cells growing under broad spectrum white light do not show similar changes in pigmentation upon inoculation.
Issue: growth light levels under white light are not the same.  Possibly express on PUR basis for better comparability?

## CCA increases PUR and growth rates
These picocyanobacteria show an increase in PUR under the conditions where CCA occurs, after inoculation from stationary phase, under green light (for PC-rich strains), or under red light (for PE-rich strains).  This increase in PUR furthermore corresponds to an increase in growth rate for the strains performing CCA.

Comments

Comments and suggestions (07.2022):

Think about faceting. Could facet by growth light to bring out interaction; does high growth light allow strain to over come ‘wrong’ colour?

Think about how to pool data from runs and possibly generate a common error bar?

Possible: Make symbol size proportional to SE of run fit and then calculate an overall SE across all replicates taking each replicate as a point OR in caption state SE on individual determinations of growth rates were always < …. absolute or proportional

Strain without PE is far more ‘fixed’ in response to colour; strongly favours 660 Strain with PE BA127R appears more able to accommodate changing colour from green to red…

Generally set Y axis to start at 0

Presenting Chl or PC or PE per cell after a fixed interval is fine as long as there is some ‘reason’ for the interval. Presenting absolute Chl mL-1 after fixed interval needs to be presented careful and is only useful in terms of potential to dominate habitat within a reasonable period….

Chl cell-1 could be usefully compared to measures of PSII cell-1 if we can get them from the calibrations…

(Conceptually Doug would prefer PE/PC unless the field generally uses PC/PE - done)

Basis for ratio: ug PC/ug PE? Peak PC/Peak PE…

From OLIS could be peak height or peak area after deconvolution…

Extract OLIS data to confirm/alter interpretations from filter data…

Extract slopes of O2 umol L-1 s-1 from O2 data Replot slopes vs. incident light

Compare O2 slopes to PSII ETR and/or JVPSII slopes to get O2 : e-… is achieved conversion of PSII ETR to O2 similar or variable?

Mechanistically always 1 O2 : 4 e- from PSII, but re-consumption of e- and O2 can alter measured ratio. Compare growth rates per PSII ETR and growth rates per O2; does PSII ETR limit achieved growth rate or do intervening processes alter conversion of net reductant (complement of measure O2 evolution) to growth

Comments and suggestions (21.11.2022):

Tubes under green or red were inoculated from white light precultures so first days in MultiCulti spectra will be changing

Figure Raw Growth. Formatted example of MultiCulti output (could be a ‘Supplemental’).

Figure Growth. Multipanel figure of growth rates somehow? Depending upon order of coverage could be first or last? But probably, first. This is probably a bar and whiskers plot with a bar/whiskers for each growth combination of strain, colour and light level How to organize? Could emphasize strain to strain contrast BA127 R cvs. BA77G under 60 and Green Then BA127 R cvs. BA77G under 300 and Green …. Or, could think of some sort of scatter plot heat map? Heat map for each strain each heat map with 4 cells for colour and light level?

Decide how to estimate growth rates - Do not number figures until we are finished. Name them. We may need a panel Letter on each ‘facet’ or maybe not depending upon journal. There is a way (‘CowPlot?’) or other to add letters to each panel. We will use the code to add the ‘variable’ name as well as the variable ‘value’ to the facet labels (later)

Think of Y axis scaling; why did ggplot scale to 0.2 A when maximum value is only ~0.08? Are there missing points? #Fixed
Consider whether to normalize spectra to common wavelength absorbance or not? Consider normalization to A680 or A440 #Done - at 440

To emphasize CCA changes in PC and PE, consider overlay of spectra from green and red light. What is the peak at 480 nm? phycourobilin? carotenoids Also: lab tests with Mireille; is there something wrong with the baseline correction b/c spectral peaks seem to be asymmetric; instead of gaussian

To normalize, probably something like mutate(Anorm = A/A[nm == 440] To lower noise, we might normalize to something like the mean of A 438-442…

Why is the plateau reached at 0.8, across growth conditions?

Figure “OlisSpectra” shows: -both strains change PC/PE ratio depending upon growth light colour (show CCA of some form) -both strains show a 480 nm peak which may increase under high light? -both strains show change in the PB to Chl ratio under low to high light? -estimate peaks normalized to scatter? or content per cell? -consider deconvolutions (code draft exists but not yet run) -consider plotting metric of light capture capacity vs. growth rate if we estimate cellular photosynthetic absorbance X PAR can we predict growth rate? -does CCA alter the growth return on incident light -we can estimate ‘in silico’ b/c you have the whole cell spectra for red light, and the growth rate for red light, and vice versa for green light so we can take whole cell absorbance under red light and multiply by hypothetical incident green light

Add r overlay incident light spectra on top of absorbance spectra?

Mix of ‘techincal’ measures and measures from separate tubes? Debate what is a ‘replicate’; each panel contains measures from at least 2 tubes, usually 3; some ‘replicates’ are remeasurements of subsamples from the same tube the next day All measures taken from actively growth cultures (exponential…); and we have high resolution growth curves

What about other growth metrics; Turner chlorophyll? PICO cell counts? ClarioStar absorbance
Ask Doug how he calculated the light response curves of photochemical and non-photochemical quenching for cyanobacteria
